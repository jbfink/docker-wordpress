(note: [Eugene Ware](http://github.com/eugeneware) has a Docker wordpress container build on nginx with some other goodies; you can check out his work [here](http://github.com/eugeneware/docker-wordpress-nginx).)


(N.B. the way that Docker handles permissions may vary depending on your current Docker version. If you're getting errors like
```
dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: permission denied
```
when you run the below commands, simply use sudo. This is a [known issue](https://twitter.com/docker/status/366040073793323008).)


This repo contains a recipe for making a [Docker](http://docker.io) container for Wordpress, using Linux, Apache and MySQL. 
To build, make sure you have Docker [installed](http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/), clone this repo somewhere, and then run:
```
docker build -rm -t <yourname>/wordpress .
```

Or, alternately, build DIRECTLY from the github repo like some sort of AMAZING FUTURO JULES-VERNESQUE SEA EXPLORER:
```
docker build -rm -t <yourname>/wordpress git://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress.git
```

Then run it! Woo! 
```
docker run -d -p 80 -p 22 <yourname>/wordpress
```


Check docker logs after running to see MySQL root password and Wordpress MySQL password, as so

```
echo $(docker logs <container-id> | grep password)
```

(note: you won't need the mysql root or the wordpress db password normally)


Find your container ID:
```
docker ps
```

Then find the external port assigned to your container:
```
docker port <container-id> 80 
```

Visit in a webrowser, then fill out the form. No need to mess with wp-config.php, it's been auto-generated with proper values. 


Note that this image now has a user account (appropriately named "user") and passwordless sudo for that user account. The password is generated upon startup; check logs for "ssh user password", docker ps for the port assigned to 22, and something like this to get in: 

```
ssh -p <port> user@localhost
```
